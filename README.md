#/**< DICE GAME - RULES AND GAMEPLAY
#- Each player has to choose, when his turn comes, between "hold" and "roll".
#Hold means you stay that round and give the dice to the other player. Roll
#means that you roll the dice. Each time the player rolls the dice, the number
#he rolls will be added at the player's sum. If a player has rolled
#number 1, then the player's sum resets to 1 and the dice is given to the
#other player. Winning means reaching a sum of 50. */
